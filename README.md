# Cryptographic Event Log Specification

This repository contains the **Cryptographic Event Log** specification, a
mechanism designed to securely record, manage, and verify changes to data in
decentralized systems using a log file that is secured using cryptographic
techniques.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Trust**: Supports independent verification of data changes
  without central authorities.
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Ensures tamper-evident records using
  cryptographic proofs.
- **Extensibility**: Adapts to various use cases, such as DID document changes
  and ActivityPub object modifications.

## Example Use Cases

1. **DID Document Management**: Securely track changes to decentralized
   identifiers without requiring blockchain solutions.
2. **ActivityPub Logs**: Enable verifiable editing and sharing of posts across
   federated social networks.
